# Interactive Shopping List

This project is a simple interactive shopping list web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstraps 5 and JavaScript. 
It allows users to dynamically add items to a shopping list, mark items as purchased, and clear the entire list.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Users can enter new items into the input field and click "Add" to add them to the shopping list.
- **Mark Purchased:** Clicking on an item in the list toggles its purchased status (displayed with a strikethrough for purchased items).
- **Clear List:** Clears all items from the shopping list when the "Clear List" button is clicked.
